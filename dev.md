1. (+) Growth meters on root root.
2. (+) Level on branch.

# Large scale changes.

* UI drawing, include bitmaps.
* Instantiate multiple plants with different strategies.
* Finalize tech tree.
* Balance soil:

  * Working model of replenishing nitro & water 
    * (let's say that water is always present, and nitro comes from above)
  * Nitro coming from above.
  * Water coming from water-carrying layers.
