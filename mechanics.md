The plant consumes:
* water
* nitro
* sunlight

The least of these resources defines the mass it grows by.

The mass is then distributed into the root (upper part is abstracted away so far),
proportionally to amount of resource that branch provides, multiplied by resource demand.

Each part of the root has its own soil surrounding it,
and pulls water/nitro surrounding it proportionally to its mass (or rather area?..).

If a part gets less water/nitro than what it needs, it withers and eventually dies.

Sunlight depends on climate and amount of neighbors.


# Limitations
* The thickness of a current branch must not be more than parent branch minus all the children.
    - Extension idea: replace it with conductivity limitation.

# Measurement units
milligrams, cm, mg/cm^3.


# Future tech:

* Parasitic roots. At level 3 we can go fully parasitic, and develop a vine!
* Symbiotic insects. Feed them fruit, get them to remove parasites or soften the soil.
* Symbiotic plants: you can increase soil pH untill it kills you; they decrease it. You must
  maintain them to survive.
